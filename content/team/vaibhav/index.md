I am engaged in the field of climate change and sustainability, with an interest in building solutions that support both people and the environment. My preparation for the UPSC Civil Services Examination gave me a strong grounding in policy, governance, and critical thinking, which continue to guide my approach to challenges. I have also been part of initiatives focused on climate action and resilience, where I gained valuable insights into community-driven solutions.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, playing basketball, and cooking, which keep me active and help me unwind creatively.
