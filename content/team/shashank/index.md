I work as a Backend Engineer and interested more in exploring the data ecosystem in the technical world. I have experience working with web technologies and recently worked with data quality and data governance and want to explore more new technologies in this field. I like reading open-source code and on top of it contributing it. I admire open source community and have been a part of it from local Indore communities to DjangoGirls Indore.

In my free time, I learn more about art from various platforms and coming up with my art style. You can think of me as an Otaku + Artist + Introverted guy who loves exploring things in-depth.
