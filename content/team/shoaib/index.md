Shoaib Ahmed is a Frontend Developer. He found his love for Frontend Development after creating the website for the Technical Fest of his college and after that, he never looked back. 

After working in the field, he realised that it's not just the frontend that he loves, but also design, colours, typography. So his next goal turned to become a Creative Developer.

Other than his professional life, Shoaib loves watching anime, reading light novels, fixing other people tech-related issues.
