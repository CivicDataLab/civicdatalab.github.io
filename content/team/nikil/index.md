Nikil has over a decade of experience in IT infrastructure and digital transformation across mission-driven and public-interest organisations, with a background spanning both technical systems and social design. His work focuses on building stable, scalable, and well-governed technology systems, with particular interest in digital public infrastructure and data-driven approaches to social impact. He is known for translating complex technical systems into practical, sustainable solutions that enable non-technical teams and institutions.

Outside of work, he enjoys travelling in the mountains, off-roading, and spending time wrenching on his bike.
