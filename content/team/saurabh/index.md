After graduating from Srishti college of Art, Design and Technology in 2012, he developed open source, smartphone-based tools for monitoring water and soil quality. in 2017, he co-founded the social enterprise Foundation for Environmental Monitoring, whose goal was to develop platforms that could scale open environmental data collection. Fueled by a growing interest in the field of the commons, he briefly pursued a PhD on commons-based practices at London Metropolitan University, followed by a few years of working as a design consultant with organizations working in the space of the commons. He joined Civic Data Lab as part of the CAN data fellowship, where he is working as a data fellow on the IDS-DRR project.
