Apoorv started his "open data" journey as a volunteer, with DataKind, to do "Data-for-good". He wasn't sure what "data-for-good" meant then. Searching for answers, he joined the two-member CivicDataLab team, in 2018, and started collaborating to make public datasets more accessible to citizens. This sounded as easy as creating an API, but soon he found about the other critical components that are needed, and are often hidden or missing, to enhance public access to information. His role in the team is to find collaboration opportunities that seek to bridge the gap between the demand and supply of key datasets especially in the areas of Law and Justice.

To curate more open datasets in this sector and contribute to an improved practice of using data to understand the nuances of Rule of Law and Access to Justice, he has lead a few research initiatives including (non-inclusive list)

- The [Justice Hub](justicehub.in/) - An open data platform to crowd source datasets and create data and tech commons in the areas of law and justice.
- [The Zombie Tracker](zombietracker.in/) - A platform to curate evidence and track the unconstitutional cases registered under section 66A of the Information Technology Act.
- [Tracking the implementation of law](https://civicdatalab.in/work/lawandjustice/childrights/) around Child Sexual Offences in the country.
