Sanjay Pinna is a Frontend Engineer who always has something to do (if not he will create something) that makes a difference, so he always has a goal in his mind to accomplish and he likes to innovate & create things which helps to solve the existing problems.

Work is a healthy addiction to him who always prefers designing, enhancing and exploring more skills in & out of tech.

Apart from this, Sanjay loves to make useful things from trash, watching movies, cooking, and knowing unknown things.
