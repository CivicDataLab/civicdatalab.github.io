My approach is highly interactive and user centric. As a reseracher, I believe in understanding users' pain areas and having an empathetic approach to the research process. Being from a design background my focus highly relies on Design Thinking Methodologies.

My skills includes context detailing, conducting independent research, advocate research findings to diverse audiences through written reports and in-person presentations.
