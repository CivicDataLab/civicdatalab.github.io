Phani is a researcher with the Public Finance Team. Despite being fresh out of his masters, Phani likes to refer to himself as the 'jack of all trades, master of none' but as the rest of the saying goes, "is better than one." His areas of interest are economics, public finance, healthcare, education, labour issues and welfare. He aims to study these areas while working towards the mission of #OpenData and #Data4Good. 

When he is not doom scrolling on Twitter, you will find him enjoying sports or watching movies and TV shows.
