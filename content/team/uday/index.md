I am a curious and driven individual who loves exploring and learning new things, both in technology and beyond. Over the course of my journey, I have worked with and gained hands-on experience in a variety of technologies including .NET, C#, WPF, SQL, ASP.NET, React, Next.js, JavaScript and Python. Recently, I built an AI CV Formatter project, which gave me valuable hands-on experience in integrating AI models into real-world applications. Outside of work, I love playing chess and I am passionate about watching anime and movies.
