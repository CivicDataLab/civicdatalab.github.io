Prajna is a Data Engineer with a knack for figuring things out from first principles. Even though he is a hardcore "techie," he has a certain flair for social sciences and believes great things can be achieved if technology and public policy can be effectively combined. When not at the keyboard churning out code, he likes to immerse himself in the realms of sci-fi, thrillers, and fantasy literature.
