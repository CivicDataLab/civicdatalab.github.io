Sai comes to CDL after exploring the solution space in the development sector from an academic and consulting approaches. After this experience, he has come to a belief that enabling and scaling these approaches through open source technologies is the need of the hour. This belief has brought Sai to CDL as a Data Engineer. He prefers to be called a problem solver than a techie! 

Outside of work, he's generally found near chai walas and cinemas - mostly on a cycle.
