description: We believe that Public Finance data sits at the intersection of various sectors and offers a unique lens to observe government priorities. We want to empower citizens by improving access to this information and helping them interact with this data. 
Toward this we curate Public Finance data by following the flow of funds through budgets all the way through to public procurements. We are working on open source tools tools to track, visualize, and analyze this information.
