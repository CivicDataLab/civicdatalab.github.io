_"A piece of knowledge, unlike a piece of physical property, can be shared by large groups of people without making anybody poorer."_ - Aaron Swartz

At CivicDataLab, we exercise openness as core to our work and encourage our partners to collaborate in open as well. We are committed to sharing our learnings and failures to grow together.

We believe that our world can become a much better place if we start thinking and working in open.
