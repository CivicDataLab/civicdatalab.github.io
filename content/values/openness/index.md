As Aaron Swartz popularly said,

_A piece of knowledge, unlike a piece of physical property, can be shared by large groups of people without making anybody poorer._

We are committed to sharing our learnings and failures to grow together. We believe that our world can become a much better place if we start thinking and working in open.
