As Aaron Swartz popularly said,

_Feedback is powerful as it serves as a guide to assist people to know how they and others perceive their involvement._

We regularly exchange feedback among partner organisations, communities and other people we work with.

We also practice effective listening and proactive communication as they are essential for effective problem-solving in an organization.
