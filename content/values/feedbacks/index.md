We understand feedback is powerful as it serves as a guide to assist people to know how they and others perceive their performance.

We regularly exchange feedback among partner organisations, communities and other people we work with. It helps us achieve more collaboration and explore new opportunities.

We also practice effective listening and proactive communication as they are essential for effective problem-solving in an organization.
