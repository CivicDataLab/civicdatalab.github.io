_Exploration and Experimentation are intrinsic to our work, from day to day tasks to organizational conducts._

By encouraging experiments, we foster a culture of research that defines who we are as an organization. What works is retained and reproduced and what doesnâ€™t is yet another lesson learned.

Innovation thrives when we continuously experiment and challenge ourselves. So as we ensure experimentation, we inherently encourage innovation.
