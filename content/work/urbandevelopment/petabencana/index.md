summary: Open platform to facilitate crowd sourced disaster reportind via social media.
context: CDL is partnering with PetaBencana in building a crowd sourced disaster reporting platfom. Quick response a the time of disaster was limited and/or delayed by the lack of real-time information for all the stakeholders. Although smaller pockets of information, reported directly by the affected people appear on social media, its utility is limited because of the unstructured nature. This platformaims towards enhancing the speed and accuracy of state response during disasters by filling these gaps.
