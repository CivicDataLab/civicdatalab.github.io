summary: Using novel data sets and techniques to effectively understand the impact of child poverty on education within urban and rural contexts.
context: Education and children services are in a unique position where they can work collaboratively across sectors to reduce structural inequalities and collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders to get it right for every child. This can be facilitated by having a deeper understanding of the mechanisms in which educational attainment can be negatively affected by poverty and subsequently support professionals to design bespoke interventions suitable to their own unique context and achieve excellence and equity of educational outcomes for children and young people.
aim: The aim of this collaboration is to determine what data sources and techniques best reflect the challenges of child poverty, and subsequently provide a means to assess the poverty related attainment gap as a result â€“ which will further allow individual school settings, local authorities and other bodies to plan targeted interventions to reduce it.
