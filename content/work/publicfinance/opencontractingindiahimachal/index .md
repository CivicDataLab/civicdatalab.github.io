summary: Health procurement performance index for Himachal Pradesh to explore procurement data.
context: How the government spends money on public goods, services, and infrastructure is referred to as Public Procurement. Public procurement data is imperative to understand government priorities and advocate for better spending. What started as a hackathon project, creating an index for procurement practices for health related procurement in Himachal Pradesh turned into a full fledged partnership, between CivicDataLab and [Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/).
solution: To open up more public procurement data in [Open Contracting Data Standards](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/) that are easy to analyse and gather insights from - on a variety of issues including public health, education and more.
