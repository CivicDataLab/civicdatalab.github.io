summary: Fixing Public Procurements with public data!
context: Public Procurements are how the government spends money on public goods, services, and infrastructure. Public procurement data is a useful source to understand government priorities and advocate for better spending. What started as a hackathon project, creating an index for procurement practices for health related procurements turned into a full fledged partnership, with CivicDataLab now working with Open Contracting Partnership.
solution: To open up more public procurement data in interoperable formats that are easy to analyse and gather insights from this data about public health, education and more.
