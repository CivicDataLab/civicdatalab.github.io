name: Open Budgets India Platform - 2.0
image: ./image.jpg
summary: The largest repository of budget documents in India. 15,000 and counting.
context: Governments in India are not transparent enough to ensure accountability in the allocation & spending of public resources. The little data available in the open are mostly not in machine readable formats, thereby hindering timely analysis & vigorous public participation. The Open Budgets India platform, built in partnership with the Centre for Budget Governance and Accountability (CBGA), is the single largest repository of Indian budget documents across different tiers of governments with more than 14,000 documents & growing. Hosted on CKAN, a popular open-source open data sofware, it's an epitome of spirited public service. Dashboards, visualisations, & machine readable data on the platform has helped hasten the pace of analysis, especially at the sub-national level. Resources created to demystify the budget processes have helped the public to understand & contribute to the wider discourse.
