We are currently in brainstorming phase for following two projects

LIFT - We are part of 7 teams across the globe working for public procurement reforms across different geographies over the span of next 18 months via OpenData & participatory processes. We look forward to learn more from  We want to use public procurement to improve equitable access to flood relief and control of goods, services and works in Assam. We define our ultimate success as substantial progress in the next 3 years in realizing SDG 11.5. The measurable impact we want to work toward is:  Equitable distribution of public goods, services and works procured for flood relief such as temporary shelters, relief packages, restoration of damaged areas and flood management resources such as construction of flood barriers, soil erosion prevention and soil recovery services so that public spending matches citizens’ needs.

Open Contracting Assam - Development in Assam has lagged relative to the rest of India because of various reasons. There is a demanding need to solve some of the inequities affecting the overall health and wellbeing of the citizens of Assam. We aim to work on Equitable Health & Safety for All.
