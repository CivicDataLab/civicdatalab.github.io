summary:  Analyse trends and patterns in budget allocation and expenditures for the law and justice sector.  
context:  |
  The [Budgets for Justice](https://budgets.justicehub.in/about) initiative, launched January 2022, is a curated open data platform that brings together open budget data from the Union Government of India over the last few years to reveal trends and patterns in budget allocation and expenditures for the law and justice sector. Our objective is to make budget data more accessible, usable and comprehensive so we can stay informed about how the law and justice sector (including courts, police, prison, legal aid etc.) is funded and sourced.

  **Features of the Budgets for Justice platform**

  - [Curated datasets](https://budgets.justicehub.in/datasets) which include budget data between the years 2015-16 and 2021-22 for specific schemes under different ministries and departments  
  - Explorers to visualize and compare budget data
  - Curated conversations and discussions with experts in the areas of public finance and law and justice to help understand the budgeting process and the data.
