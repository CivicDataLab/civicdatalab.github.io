summary: A workshop for legal practioners on learning to work with data.
context: |
  We conducted a training program for a team of lawyers, who undertake doctrinal and empirical research on the Indian judiciary, at the [Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/). In these sessions we shared insights on processes to handle judicial data, working with open data tools and frameworks for data analysis and data visualsations, working with databases, processing datasets using SQL, handling geospatial datasets, and working with qualitative datasets. We designed these sessions in consultation with the JALDI team as per their requirements and expected outcomes.
