Open Contracting India is an initiative by CivicDataLab and Open Contracting Partnership aimed at making public procurement (government tendering process) more efficient, effective and inclusive.

We do this by onboarding governments to best practices and international data standards, developing tools and platforms to analyse data to inform decision-making and building use cases and resource material to build capacity of stakeholders.

We created Himachal Pradesh Health Procurement Index and Assam Public Procurement Explorer to publish open access procurement data along with analytics to assess the efficiency, competitiveness, and value for money. We are currently working on developing a decision making framework for improving flood management and climate change response in Assam.
