    CivicDataLab recently facilitated a one-day workshop in Patna, Bihar, aimed at providing mid and senior-level officials from the Department of Rural Development, Government of Bihar, with insights into Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. The agenda covered fundamental AI concepts, discussion of AI use-cases tailored to Bihar's agricultural context, and deliberation on ethical considerations and risk mitigation strategies.
    
    The workshop commenced with an Introduction to AI session, providing attendees with a foundational understanding of AI technology. Participants then explored AI use-cases relevant to Bihar's agricultural sector, drawing from existing work under the Agriculture Information Exchange Platform (AIEP). This was followed by group discussions which were centred on identifying challenges and defining priorities for future AI projects in the state. Through collective brainstorming, attendees identified key areas for further exploration and implementation of AI initiatives. 
    
    The workshop also provided a platform for deliberating on the ethical implications and risks associated with AI deployment.  Attended by 60-80 government officials, the workshop facilitated knowledge exchange and collaboration, empowering participants to leverage AI for positive change in Bihar's agricultural sector.
