There is very little systematic information on what happens in courts, how do special laws and provisions pan out in practice, to what extent have they been able to meet their purpose, what are the challenges and how can these be overcome. The only official set of data that gives some insight on implementation of laws are the NCRB’s statistics on disposal of cases by police and court in terms of charge sheeting rate, rate of conviction and pendency percentage. District level data continues to remain a challenge on all counts.","solution":"We're collaborating with HAQ - Centre for Child Rights to curate data from the district courts in Assam, Delhi and Haryana to study the implementation of the POCSO Act. Through this pilot our aim is to create an alternate dataset of indicators of justice delivery that not only has the potential to improve implementation of laws but can also help in monitoring and strengthen children’s access to justice on a regular basis.","url":"https://www.notion.so/behindbars/Child-Rights-Law-Implementation-Tracker-5ea2d8e7d33c4e2a9b69727a556523d3","github":null,"twitter":null,"linkedin":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.7507507507507507,"src":"/website-new/static/5fd63243a21f1696ce047e8941957fd7/724c8/image.jpg","srcSet":"/website-new/static/5fd63243a21f1696ce047e8941957fd7/84d81/image.jpg 250w,\n/website-new/static/5fd63243a21f1696ce047e8941957fd7/f0719/image.jpg 500w,\n/website-new/static/5fd63243a21f1696ce047e8941957fd7/724c8/image.jpg 1000w,\n/website-new/static/5fd63243a21f1696ce047e8941957fd7/d79bd/image.jpg 1500w,\n/website-new/static/5fd63243a21f1696ce047e8941957fd7/a66ad/image.jpg 2000w,\n/website-new/static/5fd63243a21f1696ce047e8941957fd7/16018/image.jpg 3024w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}},"members":{"nodes":[{"id":"8321fe05-d0cf-50e1-bb11-4ffe670c1f5a","fields":{"slug":"/team/apoorv/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Apoorv Anand","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.098901098901099,"src":"/website-new/static/9cadda6aa766dc899d0ba2d0b4e3d932/a915e/apoorv.png","srcSet":"/website-new/static/9cadda6aa766dc899d0ba2d0b4e3d932/8ac63/apoorv.png 200w,\n/website-new/static/9cadda6aa766dc899d0ba2d0b4e3d932/a915e/apoorv.png 249w","sizes":"(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px"}}}}}]},"partners":{"nodes":[{"id":"c6a38cdd-8edc-5bcd-946a-c594dc8dee44","frontmatter":{"name":"HAQ: Centre for Child Rights","website":"https://www.haqcrc.org/","logo":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"width":145,"height":100,"src":"/website-new/static/ad49a74898f424142c7cf39d01c1a6c3/6c838/logo.png","srcSet":"/website-new/static/ad49a74898f424142c7cf39d01c1a6c3/6c838/logo.png 1x,\n/website-new/static/ad49a74898f424142c7cf39d01c1a6c3/b4386/logo.png 1.5x,\n/website-new/static/ad49a74898f424142c7cf39d01c1a6c3/7a6cf/logo.png 2x"}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"c978d122-d572-5323-9ae0-715af28dcb6b","nameRegex":"/Child Rights Laws Implementation Tracker/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2506524228","2865010946","806702743"]}
