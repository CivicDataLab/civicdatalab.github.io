The agenda covered fundamental AI concepts, discussion of AI use-cases tailored to Bihar's agricultural context, and deliberation on ethical considerations and risk mitigation strategies.\n\nThe workshop commenced with an Introduction to AI session, providing attendees with a foundational understanding of AI technology. Participants then explored AI use-cases relevant to Bihar's agricultural sector, drawing from existing work under the Agriculture Information Exchange Platform (AIEP). This was followed by group discussions which were centred on identifying challenges and defining priorities for future AI projects in the state. Through collective brainstorming, attendees identified key areas for further exploration and implementation of AI initiatives. \n\nThe workshop also provided a platform for deliberating on the ethical implications and risks associated with AI deployment.  Attended by 60-80 government officials, the workshop facilitated knowledge exchange and collaboration, empowering participants to leverage AI for positive change in Bihar's agricultural sector.\n","aim":null,"solution":null,"url":null,"github":null,"twitter":null,"linkedin":null,"youtube":null,"facebook":null,"newsletter":null,"resources":[{"link":"https://bit.ly/ai-workshop-patna","title":"Workshop Slide Deck","type":"Slide Deck"}],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7241379310344827,"src":"/static/0c8c56df5e577b839e6150328fe964da/0ff54/group_photo.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0c8c56df5e577b839e6150328fe964da/88b18/group_photo.jpg 300w,\n/static/0c8c56df5e577b839e6150328fe964da/c3638/group_photo.jpg 600w,\n/static/0c8c56df5e577b839e6150328fe964da/0ff54/group_photo.jpg 1200w,\n/static/0c8c56df5e577b839e6150328fe964da/06655/group_photo.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"}}}}},"partners":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"a8b31d48-8a7c-53b1-8842-41dc1b027751","nameRegex":"/Role of Artificial Intelligence in Sustainable Rural Development/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1208380572","203280391","2269431855","2668793990"]}
