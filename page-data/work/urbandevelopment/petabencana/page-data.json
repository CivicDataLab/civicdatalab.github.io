The platform allows the users to report disasters, through a web-based platform or through social media, and displays the location, type and status of disasters on a map in real-time. This platform displays reports made by citizens, along with information from conventional sources of government agencies. The platform has helped plan better responses to disasters and has helped citizens make better decisions about their safety. Since its inception in 2014, a total of 20,161 reports have been made on the platform, helping plan better response. \n\nThe platform is supported by [CogniCity](https://cognicity.info), which is a free and open source software for collection and visualisation of geospatial data. The [source code](https://github.com/petabencana) of the platform is open and free for anyone to access.\n\nThe first phase of the project (December 2019 - August 2021) focused on (i) expanding the platform to report six types of disasters (earthquake, flood, volcano, haze, forest fire, and wind), and (ii) expanding the platform to cover entire Indonesia. While the second phase of the project (August 2021 - November 2022) focuses on adding and upgrading features on the platform. \n\nCDL supports [PetaBencana.id](http://petabencana.id) in Indonesia, [MapaKalamidad.ph](https://mapakalamidad.ph) in the Philippines, and additional urban experiments with the code in Asia and beyond.\n","aim":null,"solution":null,"url":"https://petabencana.id","github":"https://github.com/petabencana","twitter":"https://twitter.com/petabencana","linkedin":null,"youtube":null,"facebook":null,"newsletter":null,"resources":[{"link":"https://medium.com/civicdatalab/exploring-the-role-of-technology-in-disaster-response-and-management-c745cca74d5c","title":"Exploring the Role of Technology in Disaster Response and Management","type":"Blog"},{"link":"https://urbanrisklab.org/work#/riskmap/","title":"RiskMap projects supported by the MIT Urban Risk Lab","type":"Similar projects"},{"link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T4s7xRbpss","title":"Story of CogniCity Open Source Software for community-led disaster response and recovery","type":"Video"},{"link":"https://www.oecd-forum.org/posts/can-selfiessavelives-humanitarian-chat-bots-help-disaster-response-in-southeast-asia","title":"Can #SelfiesSaveLives?
