This can be facilitated by having a deeper understanding of the mechanisms in which educational attainment can be negatively affected by poverty and subsequently support professionals to design bespoke interventions suitable to their own unique context and achieve excellence and equity of educational outcomes for children and young people.","aim":"The aim of this collaboration is to determine what data sources and techniques best reflect the challenges of child poverty, and subsequently provide a means to assess the poverty related attainment gap as a result â€“ which will further allow individual school settings, local authorities and other bodies to plan targeted interventions to reduce it.","solution":null,"url":"https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-platform-research","github":"https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-platform-research","twitter":null,"linkedin":null,"facebook":null,"newsletter":null,"resources":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/website-new/static/a8ea1a9b23e6ea91a6ff8b5b18f5fd82/0ff54/image.jpg","srcSet":"/website-new/static/a8ea1a9b23e6ea91a6ff8b5b18f5fd82/88b18/image.jpg 300w,\n/website-new/static/a8ea1a9b23e6ea91a6ff8b5b18f5fd82/c3638/image.jpg 600w,\n/website-new/static/a8ea1a9b23e6ea91a6ff8b5b18f5fd82/0ff54/image.jpg 1200w,\n/website-new/static/a8ea1a9b23e6ea91a6ff8b5b18f5fd82/b53a4/image.jpg 1800w,\n/website-new/static/a8ea1a9b23e6ea91a6ff8b5b18f5fd82/28480/image.jpg 2400w,\n/website-new/static/a8ea1a9b23e6ea91a6ff8b5b18f5fd82/a5ecf/image.jpg 2500w","sizes":"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"}}}}},"members":{"nodes":[{"id":"2e9fd987-db6d-5a03-bd49-235ba0d3b64b","fields":{"slug":"/team/akhil/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Akhil Sagiraju","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1,"src":"/website-new/static/b3fcca22a137e42f5f91e47583349e44/f1142/akhil.jpg","srcSet":"/website-new/static/b3fcca22a137e42f5f91e47583349e44/fd013/akhil.jpg 200w,\n/website-new/static/b3fcca22a137e42f5f91e47583349e44/25252/akhil.jpg 400w,\n/website-new/static/b3fcca22a137e42f5f91e47583349e44/f1142/akhil.jpg 783w","sizes":"(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"}}}}},{"id":"bcb75cef-abc2-591c-8831-835e4957fb82","fields":{"slug":"/team/arpit/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Arpit Arora","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1,"src":"/website-new/static/232a85d6dcca3a00fccb355630faee29/3891b/arpit.png","srcSet":"/website-new/static/232a85d6dcca3a00fccb355630faee29/8ac63/arpit.png 200w,\n/website-new/static/232a85d6dcca3a00fccb355630faee29/3891b/arpit.png 400w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}},{"id":"2e84ae1c-ad28-5537-af7d-9e86f8f99aaf","fields":{"slug":"/team/dc/"},"frontmatter":{"name":"Deepthi Chand","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.5384615384615385,"src":"/website-new/static/6a93ae8448f5a6c6c21ab84215ffd8a8/2f1b1/dc.jpg","srcSet":"/website-new/static/6a93ae8448f5a6c6c21ab84215ffd8a8/fd013/dc.jpg 200w,\n/website-new/static/6a93ae8448f5a6c6c21ab84215ffd8a8/25252/dc.jpg 400w,\n/website-new/static/6a93ae8448f5a6c6c21ab84215ffd8a8/2f1b1/dc.jpg 800w,\n/website-new/static/6a93ae8448f5a6c6c21ab84215ffd8a8/0ff54/dc.jpg 1200w,\n/website-new/static/6a93ae8448f5a6c6c21ab84215ffd8a8/06655/dc.jpg 1600w,\n/website-new/static/6a93ae8448f5a6c6c21ab84215ffd8a8/67f22/dc.jpg 3997w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}]},"partners":{"nodes":[{"id":"f2315217-a3aa-52a2-9432-0bfaa33ee852","frontmatter":{"name":"Data for Children Collaborative with UNICEF","website":"https://www.dataforchildrencollaborative.com/","logo":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"width":180,"height":43,"src":"/website-new/static/f9b6fe32159b555c880165317cc7434b/8d052/logo.jpg","srcSet":"/website-new/static/f9b6fe32159b555c880165317cc7434b/8d052/logo.jpg 1x,\n/website-new/static/f9b6fe32159b555c880165317cc7434b/08454/logo.jpg 1.5x,\n/website-new/static/f9b6fe32159b555c880165317cc7434b/e2788/logo.jpg 2x"}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"c845a1d5-9e84-5c35-83eb-839089300801","nameRegex":"/NORAL/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1001143701","2269431855","2506524228","2865010946"]}
