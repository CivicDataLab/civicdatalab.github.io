The challenge sought to curate a \ncollaborative entrepreneurial effort that increases and evolves the use of data in the areas of law and justice. \nThe core of Justice Hub is an [open data platform](https://justicehub.in/dataset) that curates datasets for making legal and justice data open, accessible and actionable. \nBy becoming a shared and open resource for discovering and publishing well documented datasets and other information resources, \nJusticeHub aims to enhance the access to data related to law and justice in the country. \n\nMaking datasets actionable requires a collaborative effort from the community. In this direction, the Justice Hub has initiated \na few initiatives like the [Summer of Data program](https://justicehub.in/initiatives/summer-of-data-2021), where we worked with students from law universities across India \nto curate a well documented datasets on the Judges of the High Courts of India, and [Budgets for Justice](https://budgets.justicehub.in/about) \nwhere we're building tools to explore and analyse the budget data for key schemes around law and justice from various ministries and departments. \n","aim":null,"solution":null,"url":"https://justicehub.in","github":"https://github.com/justicehub-in","twitter":"https://twitter.com/JusticeHubIndia","linkedin":null,"youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkETmnBNNjvvOJklZenNQaA","facebook":null,"newsletter":"https://dataforjustice.substack.com","resources":[{"link":"https://medium.com/civicdatalab/the-justice-hub-in-numbers-8a33dd72aee9","title":"Justice Hub - In Numbers","type":"Blog"},{"link":"https://bit.ly/csv-khoj","title":"About KHOJ - Presentation for csv,conf,v7","type":"Github Repo"},{"link":"https://justicehub.in/initiatives/summer-of-data-2021","title":"Summer of Data - 2021","type":"Initiative"},{"link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkETmnBNNjvvOJklZenNQaA","title":"Date with Data - Conversations with data contributors","type":"Interviews"},{"link":"https://budgets.justicehub.in/","title":"Budgets for Justice","type":"Initiative"},{"link":"https://medium.com/civicdatalab/budgets-for-justice-making-law-and-justice-budgets-accessible-and-actionable-28eb56a0d348","title":"Budgets for Justice: Making Law and Justice budgets Accessible and Actionable","type":"Blog"},{"link":"https://medium.com/civicdatalab/the-state-of-data-in-the-judicial-sector-9a178a143e","title":"The State of Data in the Judicial Sector","type":"Blog"},{"link":"https://idronline.org/developing-our-digital-commons/","title":"Developing our digital commons","type":"Blog"},{"link":"https://dataforjustice.substack.com","title":"DataforJustice - Newsletter","type":"NewsLetter"},{"link":"https://www.thequint.com/voices/opinion/legal-datasets-information-technology-access-to-data","title":"Cost of Not Sharing Legal Datasets?
