# The new CivicDataLab website

## About Us !

We are a research lab working with the goal of using data, tech, design and social science to strengthen the course of civic engagements in India. We work to harness the potential of open-source movement  to enable citizens  to engage better with public reforms. We aim to grow data and tech capacity of governments, nonprofits, think-tanks, media houses, universities etc to enable data-driven decision making at scale.

## Background

#### Challenges w/ the Old Website
- Single landing page, with limited information around the work we do and the solutions we build.
- Someone with no prior knowledge of CivicDataLab can guage very little about our work and offerings.
- Lack of brand identity, only the company logo was accessible with limited information on our background and values.
- Our Bandhus didn't have a place to express themselves and showcase their work on the website.

#### How does `v2.0` of the website solve this?

- Multiple pages dedicated to different aspects or our offerings and work with a sector level classification.
- An about page explaining our approach the the work bringing in the 4 pillars; data, tech, desing and social science.
- Project level pages to share all the resources and context for individual projects.
- Individual pages for each Bandhu where they can highlight their work, favourite quotes and select accent colours.
